This is a simple project I made to be able to use gears of war pc 2007 without startup.exe.

It is also meant to be used directly with https://github.com/KILLER-CHIEF/xlivelessness when its completed for possible future multiplayer stuff.

To use:

1) Get a copy of https://github.com/KILLER-CHIEF/xlivelessness dll
2) Put the xlivelessness dll into gears of war "Binaries" folder
3) Create the following folder path in "Binaries", "xlln\modules"
4) Put the dll from this project in there
